\subsection{Scope}
The service Data4Help is designed to monitor the location and health status of individual registered to it using wearable devices. Upon registration the users agree to the acquisition and usage of data by TrackMe. 
The collected data is available to third parties to request after registering to Data4Help. The first possibility is requesting data on a specific individual, for which it is required an identification of the user; The second possibility is accessing anonymized data on groups of users, so the system will have to allow third parties to filter the users by age, geographic area, weight, etc. while keeping the data anonymized.
For both possibilities third parties can simply acquire the data stored or subscribe to receive the data as soon as it is produced.
AutomatedSOS is a service designed to provide emergency health support(?) for elderly people, to integrate on top of Data4Help. Those usersâ€™ parameters about blood pressure, heartbeat and blood oxygenation are constantly checked: whenever they represent a critical health condition, AutomatedSOS, within 5 seconds from the drop of those values, contacts an emergency service asking to send an ambulance at the user location.
