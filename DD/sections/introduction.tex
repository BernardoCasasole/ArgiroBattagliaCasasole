\section{Scope}
Data4Help means to provide services to authenticated users only. Those services are addressed to both:
\begin{itemize}
\item	Individual Users
\item Third parties Users
\end{itemize}
To dispatch specific functionalities to the user they are reserved, Data4Help System avails itself of:
\begin{itemize}
\item a Mobile App, reserved to individual users
\item a Web Page, reserved to third party users.
\end{itemize}
The mobile app, using the GPS location provided by the smartphone, allows the individual user to:
\begin{itemize}
\item check his own health parameters (measured by a smartwatch)
\item enable and disable additional services (AutomatedSOS and Track4Run)
\item give or deny authorization to every third party to access health data about himself.  
\end{itemize}
Data4Helps System handles both data of the past and real time ones.
The web page allows the Third-party user to:
\begin{itemize}
\item make requests for statistical data of the past or real time
\item make a request for individual data of the past or real time (the request is forwarded to the individual user)
\item organize and watch run competitions.
\end{itemize}
This factorization allows the system to be accurate in providing every user with all and only resources he has the right to access: authentication and authorization processes rely on the access control. \\ \\
The necessity to use a mobile app could prevent third parties from choosing Data4Help over other services of data collection: Data4Help Web Page can be easily accessed from a browser hosted on a computer or a mobile.
