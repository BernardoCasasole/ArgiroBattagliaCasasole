Third parties will be able also to request anonymized data by specifying a group of people according to relevant filters as age, weight, geographical area, etc. 
Data4Help will analyse the request and decide whether it is possible to properly anonymize the requested data and will notify the third party upon its decision. If possible, will grant access to the requested data.
\subsubsection{Data subscription}
