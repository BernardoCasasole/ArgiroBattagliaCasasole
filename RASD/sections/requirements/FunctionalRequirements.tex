Alice's gym woluld like to collect data on their members so they asked Alice to install the Data4Help application. She downloaded it, entered her name, age, ID, password etc., she accepted the data sharing policy and, after receiving an email, confirmed her email address. Now she recived a notification from the app, asking if she wants to accept or deny the request for her data, made from her gym, which she accepts.
\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
Bob, historic user of Data4Help, is getting older and older so he wants to activate the emergency service, AutomatedSOS. He logs in the application and request the activation of the service.
Incidentally the very next day, while working from home, he has a cardiac arrest. Immediatly the application calls the emergency service that send an ambulance to his house, saving his life.
\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
Charles and Devon are passionate runners and love to compete one with the other. To be able to find more opportunities to race they installe the Data4Help application and activate the Track4Run service. Soon they enroll in a race as partecipants but unfortunatly Devon the day before of the race get injured, so he forfeit from the run. The day after, wishing to know how his friend Charles is doing he opens the app and spectates the run. After Charles arrives first he gets a call from Devon telling him that next time he will arrive second.
\subsubsection{Scenario 4}
EvilCorp wants to collect data on the inhabitants of a small town. Felix the supervisor registers the company on the website, entering name, ID(VAT), etc. and waits for a confirmation email. Then he enters the website again and enters the data required to make a request for data on individual users living in the area. Unfortunately for EvilCorp there not enough users to properly anonymize the data so the request is rejected and Felix is fired.
\subsubsection{Scenario 5}
GymForEveryone wants to personalize more the workout session of its premium members. In order to do so Helen, the manager, log in the gym account and sends, one by one, the request to the data of the premium members. The day after some of them have accepted the request while some of them denied it. With the data obtained she starts creating new workout sessions.
\subsubsection{Scenario 6}
IHealth wants to monitor large groups of people in order to collect data for research. In ordet to do that its researchers created a company account created via website. Jhon the scientist then makes a request to monitor the data of people living in Milan to evaluate the stress levels. Being able to properly anonymize the data, the system give him access to the live data. After some days, shocked by the results, start funding a campaign to urge Milan to work less and relax more.
