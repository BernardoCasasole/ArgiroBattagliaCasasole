\subsection{Standards Compliance}
The web page will be developed taking in account Standards Compliance defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) with the purpose of enhancing interoperability among different browsers. 
\\
\\
The web page needs it’s compliance to be tested, before the release, submitting the website URL on the Validator Tool (validator.w3.org) and consulting errors reported: fully compliance (meaning zero errors on Validator Tool) it’s really hard to achieve and in most of the cases it’s not necessary, moreover there are cases in which it’s needed to break some of W3C rules to make something work in a specific desired way on every browser. 
\\
\\
The web page to release needs the result coming from Validator Tool to have at most 10 errors, an indefinite number of warnings are allowed.
