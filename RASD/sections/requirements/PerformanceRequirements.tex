The Data4Help Mobile Application must respond within 5 seconds from the reception of a datum that reports a parameter that is under the threshold of health range. The response indeed corresponds to take contact with Emergency Service that takes charge of the request and sends an ambulance. \\
Real time data available on server are necessary, for this reason the mobile application needs to have a worst-case latency under 30 ms that does not consider the time spent to reach the server over the network. This latency value only refers to the internal application process which starts from the reception of a datum and ends with its forwarding.  \\ 
System availability must be at least 99.995\% which means that no more than 26.30 minutes of downtime in a year is allowed.  \\
Failure events cannot exceed three times over a year as reported in system reliability.
