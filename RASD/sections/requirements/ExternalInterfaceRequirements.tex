\subsection{Third-party User Interface}
The following mock-ups intend to represent a likely web page layout 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{Mocks/Desktop_Login.PNG}
\caption{\textbf{Login window}: Third-Party users must insert their data in order to log in their (personal) account. Password can be recovered whenever it has been forgotten. Once all fields are filled, third-parties users need to press “register” button.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{Mocks/Desktop_Sign_In.PNG}
\caption{\textbf{Sign In window}: Third-Party users have to insert their data in order to become Third-Parties users: if the visitor has a VAT he has to insert it as ID, otherwise another unique identifier must be inserted.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{Mocks/Desktop_D4H_Main.PNG}
\caption{\textbf{D4H Main window}: Third-party Users can monitor their requests for one-time data and their subscriptions. They can make a new request for a subscription or a one-time data of an individual (typing the social security number or any equivalent security code). They can also get API key or make requests for data regarding a group of people (one-time data or subscription, the D4H data request constrains window will follow).}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{Mocks/Desktop_D4H_Constraints.PNG}
\caption{\textbf{D4H data request constraints window}: Third-Party Users can specify the constraint to be applied to group data request.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{Mocks/Desktop_T4R_Main.PNG}
\caption{\textbf{T4R Main window}: Third-Party Users can manage the competition they organized: check subscribers, delete the competition before it occurs and monitor the competition while takes place. They can organize a new competition (field about constraints can be empty) or monitor an ongoing one. }
\end{figure}

\subsection{Hardware interfaces}
The Data4Help System consists just in a software application and is not using any hardware interfaces indeed; the IU, as already mentioned in the assumption [D10], must be provided with a smartphone internet connection and GPS, a smartwatch or an equivalent wearable device. Bluetooth might also be required in the wearable device-smartphone connection.  \\
\subsection{Software interfaces}
The Data4Help System provides a series of functionalities that are based on the precise location of the user in every moment: none of the services provided by AutomatedSOS and Track4Run are effective without a map. The map to be used needs to be user-friendly and available on every smartphone: Google Maps meets these needs. The development will be done with tools and API provided by Google Maps Platform (https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/).  \\
To monitor health parameters the Data4Help System needs the user to constantly wear a smartwatch:
it access data measured by the smartwatch making use of Data Layer APIs.\\
\\
The Data4Help System needs to interface with a database that is accessed with a DBMS (PostgreSQL). 

\subsection{Communication interfaces}
The Data4Help System implementation should support real time communication: developers are up to ensure a secure and rapid data transmission availing themselves of communication protocols at transport layer such as UDP, TCP, real time protocols.  \\
At application layer must be used HTTPS (HTTP + SSL certificate) to transmit safely sensitive data while at network layer it could be used IP v6 to have a more efficient routing. 
SMTP protocol could be used to verify the e-mail provided by the user.
